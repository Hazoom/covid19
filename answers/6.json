          "The WHO's initial focus was on managing droplet and contact transmission, but it has since recognized the role fomites play as well. 2 Fomites are important because while populations generally protect themselves from clearly observable droplet transmissions (coughing, sneezing), being invisible, fomite transmission is regularly overlooked both in hospitals and communities. 3e5 Consequently, during the community saturation phase, fomite transmission may play a larger role than droplet transmission as a mechanism in emergent infectious diseases. 3e6 In this paper we argue that by implementing enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB), 6 an extension of the TCB deployed by Taiwan during the 2003 SARS outbreak, countries can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19's impact.",
