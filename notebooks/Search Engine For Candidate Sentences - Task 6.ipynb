    "- Guidance on ways to scale up NPIs in a more coordinated way (e.g., establish funding, infrastructure and authorities to support real time, authoritative (qualified participants) collaboration with all states to gain consensus on consistent guidance and to mobilize resources to geographic areas where critical shortfalls are identified) to give us time to enhance our health care delivery system capacity to respond to an increase in cases.\n",
    "- Rapid design and execution of experiments to examine and compare NPIs currently being implemented. DHS Centers for Excellence could potentially be leveraged to conduct these experiments.\n",
    "- Rapid assessment of the likely efficacy of school closures, travel bans, bans on mass gatherings of various sizes, and other social distancing approaches.\n",
    "- Methods to control the spread in communities, barriers to compliance and how these vary among different populations..\n",
    "- Models of potential interventions to predict costs and benefits that take account of such factors as race, income, disability, age, geographic location, immigration status, housing status, employment status, and health insurance status.\n",
    "- Policy changes necessary to enable the compliance of individuals with limited resources and the underserved with NPIs.\n",
    "- Research on why people fail to comply with public health advice, even if they want to do so (e.g., social or financial costs may be too high).\n",
    "- Research on the economic impact of this or any pandemic. This would include identifying policy and programmatic alternatives that lessen/mitigate risks to critical government services, food distribution and supplies, access to critical household supplies, and access to health diagnoses, treatment, and needed care, regardless of ability to pay.\n"

      "It is necessary to implement a community-based comprehensive intervention, which requires support from national polices, to ensure the availability of medical resources, such as essential drugs, equipment, and human resources, and to improve the affordability of COPD therapy for patients.\n",

      "Understanding the length of active monitoring needed to limit the risk for missing SARS-CoV-2 infections is necessary for health ORIGINAL RESEARCH departments to effectively use limited resources.\n",

      "A country's response capacity depends on the strength of its emergency preparedness and the regular testing and updating of national plans and capacities. 30 An effec tive response to an outbreak depends not only on the availability of adequate human resources and financing, but also on the ability to manage emergency logistics (including the handling of supply chains for essential products that are required during an emergency).\n",

      "Social planning and health policy explore, on the one hand, the type and quantity of health services and goods needed by the population and on the other, the human, material, and financial resources, i.e., the necessary inputs for the system to operate as well as the outputs and outcomes.\n",

      "Appropriate health care ■ Poorly controlled diabetics (whether Type I or II), with fasting glucose levels above 14mmol/L (250 mg/dL): • these patients should be referred for improved control of their blood sugar before non-emergency surgery is performed • if emergency surgery is needed, then prophylactic antibiotics are prudent, using the accepted principles of such use ■ Infections in diabetic patients: • regardless of the patient's diabetic control levels, infections should be managed aggressively, including possible early referral to oral and maxillofacial surgeon ■ Routine non-surgical procedures: • routine dental treatment or short minor surgical procedures under local anaesthesia can be carried out with no special precautions apart from ensuring that treatment does not interfere with eating ■ Surgical procedures: • the essential requirement is to avoid hypoglycaemia and also keep hyperglycaemia below levels which may be harmful because of delayed wound healing or phagocyte dysfunction; the desired whole blood glucose level is therefore ~5mmol/L • special management considerations apply to the diabetic who is to undergo anything more than simple dentoalveolar procedures under GA (Table 3 .45); the effects of stress and trauma may raise insulin requirements and precipitate ketosis • precautions required during oral surgery in diabetics depend mainly on: the type and severity of the diabetes and complications such as autonomic neuropathy that may predispose to hypotension or cardiac arrest, the type of anaesthetic, the extent of surgery, the extent of interference with normal feeding postoperatively ■ Many different management regimens have been suggested and each patient requires individual handling: the following therefore provides only general guidelines and the diabetic consultant should always decide the final regimen.\n",

      "To fight a potential pandemic like COVID-19, improved efficiency for resource allocation will be critical since a massive outbreak will rapidly consume public health and medical resources.\n",

      "The range of the values for the incubation period is essential to epidemiological case definitions, and is required to determine the appropriate duration of quarantine.\n",
